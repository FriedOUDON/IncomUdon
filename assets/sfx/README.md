IncomUdon default cue sounds
============================

This directory is the default cue-source search location.

Files used by default:
- `assets/sfx/ptt_on.wav`
- `assets/sfx/ptt_off.wav`
- `assets/sfx/carrier_sense.wav`

These files are embedded into the app at build time via Qt resources.
To change default sounds from source, replace these files and rebuild.
